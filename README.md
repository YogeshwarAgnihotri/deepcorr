Hi,

this is my master thesis project, which is the basis of my ongoing master thesis.

deepcorr: is a reimplemention of the https://github.com/SPIN-UMass/DeepCorr/tree/master project, however my implemention gives addiition parameters and flexibility.
simplecorr: is a collection of scikitlearn models which are rather lighweight implemented on the deepcorr dataset to do also flow correlation.
shared: just a collection of shared scripts/functions used between all models.

Hf!
